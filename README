Building SCADASim as a shared lib (libscadasim.so)
==================================================
Tested in Debian 8 (Jessie)

OmNeT version: 4.2: (https://omnetpp.org/component/jdownloads/download/32-release-older-versions/2239-omnet-4-2-source-ide-tgz)
Inet version: 20111118 (http://omnetpp.org/download/contrib/models/inet-20111118-src.tgz)

1)OmNeT

    1.1)Download the recommended OmNeT and extract it.

    1.2)Add this in include in abspath.cc:
        #include <unistd.h>

    1.3)Do the modification suggested in:
        https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/omnetpp/J1zdQvFq9qc

    1.4)Add OmNeT's bin/ folder to the PATH, then you can configure/build it.
    cd to OmNeT's main folder and:
        ./configure
        make

2)Inet
    1.1)Download the recommended version of Inet, extract and cd to it.
    1.2)Build it:
        make makefiles
        make
    1.3)It should generates libinet.so in 'src' folder.

3)Finally , SCADASim
    3.1) At the top directory of SCADASim, generate Makefiles:
        make makefiles (or 'make buildbinary' to build SCADASim's simulations)

    3.2) and then you can build it:
        make

    3.3)It should generates libscamasim.so in 'src' folder.
